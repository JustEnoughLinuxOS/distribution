Just Enough Linux Operating System (JELOS) is a simple Linux distribution for ARM based devices that specializes in handhelds.  My goal is to build an operating system that has the features and capabilities that I need, and to have fun building it.

## Features
* A 64bit Linux Operating System.
* An easy to use interface using EmulationStation
* Provides RetroArch, a variety of cores, Stand Alone Emulators, PortMaster, and ThemeMaster.
* Supports FAT32, ExFAT, and EXT4 file systems on devices with a second card slot.
* 2.4GHz and 5GHz 802.11 A/B/G/N/AC WIFI support.
* Online updates for easy access to stable or development builds.
* Supports Anbernic's RG552, RG503, RG353P, RG351P/M, RG351MP, and RG351V.
* Developed by a small, friendly community.

## Installation
* Download the latest [version of JELOS](https://github.com/JustEnoughLinuxOS/distribution/releases) (.img.gz) for your device.
* Decompress the image.
* Write the image to an SDCARD using an imaging tool.  Common imaging tools include [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/), [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/), and [Win32 Disk Imager](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/).  If you're skilled with the command line, dd works fine too.

## Credits
Like any Linux distribution, this project is not the work of one person.  It is the work of many persons all over the world who have developed the open source bits without which this project could not exist.  Special thanks to CoreELEC, LibreELEC, Anbernic, and to developers and contributors across the ARM handheld community.
