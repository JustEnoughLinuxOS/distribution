# Structure of package.mk files

## Introduction

The package.mk file defines variables and functions to build a package.

## Variables
To control the build behaviour of your package, use variables in the top-down order listed here.

#### Base

| Variable    | Default | Required |Description |
|-------------|---------|----------|------------|
| PKG_NAME    | -       | yes | Name of the packaged software application. Should be lowercase |
| PKG_VERSION | -       | yes | Version of the packaged software application. If the version is a githash, please use the full githash, not the abbreviated form. |
| PKG_SHA256  | -       | yes | SHA256 hashsum of the application download file |
| PKG_ARCH    | any     | no  | Architectures for which the package builds. `any` or a space separated list of `aarch64`, `arm` or `x86_64` |
| PKG_LICENSE | -       | yes | License of the software application. [Reference](https://github.com/JustEnoughLinuxOS/distribution/tree/main/licenses) |
| PKG_SITE    | -       | yes | Site of the software application |
| PKG_URL     | -       | yes | Address at which the source of the software application can be retrieved |
| PKG_MAINTAINER | -    | no  | Your name |
| PKG_DEPENDS_BOOTSTRAP<br>PKG_DEPENDS_HOST   PKG_DEPENDS_INIT   PKG_DEPENDS_TARGET | - | no | A space separated list of name of packages required to build the software application |
| PKG_SECTION | -       | no  | virtual if the package only defines dependencies |
| PKG_SHORTDESC | -     | no<br>yes&nbsp;for&nbsp;addons | Short description of the software package |
| PKG_LONGDESC | -      | yes | Long description of the package including purpose or function within JELOS or Kodi |

#### Universal Build Option
| Variable    | Default | Required |Description |
|-------------|---------|----------|------------|
| PKG_SOURCE_DIR | -    | no  | Force the folder name that application sources are unpacked to. Used when sources do not automatically unpack to a folder with the `PKG_NAME-PKG_VERSION` naming convention. |
| PKG_SOURCE_NAME | -   | no  | Force the filename of the application sources. Used when the filename is not the basename of `PKG_URL` |
| PKG_PATCH_DIRS | -    | no  | Patches in `./patches` are automatically applied after package unpack. Use this option to include patches from an additional folder, e.g. `./patches/$PKG_PATCH_DIRS` |
| PKG_NEED_UNPACK | -   | no  | Space separated list of files or folders to include in package stamp calculation. If the stamp is invalidated through changes to package files or dependent files/folders the package is cleaned and rebuilt. e.g. `PKG_NEED_UNPACK="$(get_pkg_directory linux)"` will trigger clean/rebuild of a Linux kernel driver package when a change to the `linux` kernel package is detected. |
| PKG_TOOLCHAIN | auto  | no  | Control which build toolchain is used. For detailed information, see [reference](#toolchain-options). |
| PKG_BUILD_FLAGS | -   | no  | A space separated list of flags with which to fine-tune the build process. Flags can be enabled or disabled with a `+` or `-` prefix. For detailed information, see the [Reference](#build_flags-options). |
| PKG_PYTHON_VERSION | python2.7 | no | Define the Python version to be used. |
| PKG_IS_KERNEL_PKG | - | no  | Set to `yes` for packages that include Linux kernel modules |

#### Detailed Information for Options

##### TOOLCHAIN options

Application/packages needs different toolchains for build.
For instance `cmake` or the classic `./configure` or same very different.

For the most application/packages, the auto-detection of the toolchain works proper.
But not always. To select a specific toolchain, you only need to set the `PKG_TOOLCHAIN` variable.

| Toolchain   | Description (if needed) |
|-----------  |-------------------------|
| meson       | [Meson Build System](http://mesonbuild.com/) |
| cmake       | [CMake](https://cmake.org/) with Ninja |
| cmake-make  | [CMake](https://cmake.org/) with Make |
| autotools   | [GNU Build System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Build_System)
| configure   | preconfigured [GNU Build System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Build_System) |
| ninja       | [Ninja Build](https://ninja-build.org/) |
| make        | [Makefile Based](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) |
| manual      | only runs self writen build steps, see [Functions](#functions) |

###### Auto-Detection
The auto-detections looks for specific files in the source path.

1. `meson.build` (PKG_MESON_SCRIPT) => meson toolchain
2. `CMakeLists.txt` (PKG_CMAKE_SCRIPT) => cmake toolchain
3. `configure` (PKG_CONFIGURE_SCRIPT) => configure toolchain
4. `Makefile` => make toolchain

When none of these was found, the build abort and you have to set the toolchain via `PKG_TOOLCHAIN`

##### BUILD_FLAGS options

Build flags implement often used build options. Normally these are activated be default, but single applications/packages has problems to compile/run with these.

Set the variable `PKG_BUILD_FLAGS` in the `package.mk` to enable/disable the single flags. It is a space separated list. The flags can enabled with a `+` prefix, and disabled with a `-`.

| flag     | default  | affected stage | description |
|----------|----------|----------------|-------------|
| pic      | disabled | target/init    | [Position Independent Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position-independent_code) |
| pic:host | disabled | host/bootstrap | see above |
| lto      | disabled | target/init    | enable LTO (Link Time optimization) in the compiler and linker unless disabled via `LTO_SUPPORT`. Compiles non-fat LTO objects (only bytecode) and performs single-threaded optimization at link stage |
| lto-parallel | disabled | target/init | same as `lto` but enable parallel optimization at link stage. Only enable this if the package build doesn't run multiple linkers in parallel otherwise this can result in lots of parallel processes! |
| lto-fat  | disabled | target/init | same as `lto` but compile fat LTO objects (bytecode plus optimized assembly). This increases compile time but can be useful to create static libraries suitable both for LTO and non-LTO linking |
| lto-off  | disabled | target/init | explicitly disable LTO in the compiler and linker |
| gold     | depend on `GOLD_SUPPORT` | target/init | can only disabled, use of the GOLD-Linker |
| parallel | enabled  | all | `make` or `ninja` builds with multiple threads/processes (or not) |
| strip    | enabled  | target | strips executables (or not) |

###### Example
```
PKG_BUILD_FLAGS="+pic -gold"
PKG_BUILD_FLAGS="-parallel"
```

## Functions
All build steps in the JELOS build system are done by shell function.
These functions can overwritten in the `package.mk`. But this raises problems, when the build system is updated. To reduce the problem, most function was extended by `pre_` and `post_` scripts, to use instead.

When it is nesseary to replace configure, make and makeinstall, please use `PKG_TOOLCHAIN="manual"`.

Some of the build steps needs to be run once, like `unpack`. Other steps needs to be run multiple times, to create the toolchain (stage bootstrap & host) or to create the LE image (stage init & target). These stage specific functions have the stage as suffix, like `make_target`.

Full list of overwrittable functions.

| function                | stages specific | description |
|-------------------------|--------|-------------|
| configure_package | - | Optional function to implement late binding variable assignment (see below) |
| unpack<br>pre_unpack<br>post_unpack | - | Extract the source from the downloaded file |
| pre_patch<br>post_patch | -      | Apply the patches to the source, after extraction. The patch function it self is not allowed to overwritten |
| pre_build_\[stage]      | yes    | Runs before of the start of the build |
| pre_configure<br>pre_configure_\[stage]<br>configure_\[stage]<br>post_configure_\[stage] | yes | Configure the package for the compile. This is only relevant for toolchain, that supports it (e.g. meson, cmake, configure, manual) |
| make_\[stage]<br>pre_make_\[stage]<br>post_make_\[stage] | yes | Build of the package |
| makeinstall_\[stage]<br>pre_makeinstall_\[stage]<br>post_makeinstall_\[stage] | yes | Installation of the files in the correct pathes<br>host: TOOLCHAIN<br>target: SYSROOT and IMAGE<br>bootstrap and init: temporary destination
| addon                   | -      | Copy all files together for addon creation. This is requiered for addons |

## Late Binding variable assignment

A package will be loaded only once, by the call to `config/options`. During this process, additional package specific variables will be initialised, such as:

* `PKG_BUILD` - path to the build folder
* `PKG_SOURCE_NAME` - if not already specified, generated from `PKG_URL`, `PKG_NAME` and` PKG_VERSION`

Since these variables will not exist at the time the package is loaded, they can only be referenced **after** package has loaded. This can be accomplished by referencing these variables in the `configure_package()` function which is executed once the additional variables have been assigned.

If necessary, the following variables would be configured in `configure_package()` as they are normally relative to `${PKG_BUILD}`:
```
  PKG_CONFIGURE_SCRIPT
  PKG_CMAKE_SCRIPT
  PKG_MESON_SCRIPT
```

Further to this, toolchain variables that are defined in `setup_toolchain()` must not be referenced "globally" in the package as they will only be configured reliably after `setup_toolchain()` has been called during `scripts/build`. Any variable in the following list must instead be referenced in a package function such as `pre_build_*`, `pre_configure_*`, `pre_make_*` etc.:
```
  TARGET_CFLAGS TARGET_CXXFLAGS TARGET_LDFLAGS
  NINJA_OPTS MAKEFLAGS
  DESTIMAGE
  CC CXX CPP LD
  AS AR NM RANLIB
  OBJCOPY OBJDUMP
  STRIP
  CPPFLAGS CFLAGS CXXFLAGS LDFLAGS
  PKG_CONFIG
  PKG_CONFIG_PATH
  PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR
  PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR
  PKG_CONFIG_ALLOW_SYSTEM_CFLAGS
  PKG_CONFIG_ALLOW_SYSTEM_LIBS
  CMAKE_CONF CMAKE
  HOST_CC HOST_CXX HOSTCC HOSTCXX
  CC_FOR_BUILD CXX_FOR_BUILD BUILD_CC BUILD_CXX
  _python_sysroot _python_prefix _python_exec_prefix
```

Lastly, the following variables are assigned during `scripts/build` but some packages may need to use alternative values for these variables. To do so, the package must assign alternative values in `pre_build_*`/`pre_configure_*`/`pre_make_*` etc. functions as these functions will be called after the variables are initialised with default values in `scripts/build` but before they are used by `scripts/build`.
```
  CMAKE_GENERATOR_NINJA

  TARGET_CONFIGURE_OPTS
  TARGET_CMAKE_OPTS
  TARGET_MESON_OPTS

  HOST_CONFIGURE_OPTS
  HOST_CMAKE_OPTS
  HOST_MESON_OPTS

  INIT_CONFIGURE_OPTS
  INIT_CMAKE_OPTS
  INIT_MESON_OPTS

  BOOTSTRAP_CONFIGURE_OPTS
  BOOTSTRAP_CMAKE_OPTS
  BOOTSTRAP_MESON_OPTS
```

#### Example
```
configure_package() {
  # now we know where we're building, assign a value
  PKG_CONFIGURE_SCRIPT="${PKG_BUILD}/gettext-tools/configure"
}

post_patch() {
  # replace hardcoded stuff
  sed -i ${PKG_CONFIGURE_SCRIPT} 's|hardcoded stuff|variable stuff|'
}

pre_configure_target() {
  # add extra flag to toolchain default
  CFLAGS="${CFLAGS} -DEXTRA_FLAG=yeah"
}

post_makeinstall_target() {
  # remove unused executable, install what remains
  rm ${INSTALL}/usr/bin/bigexecutable
}
```

#### tools/pkgcheck

Use `tools/pkgcheck` to verify packages. It detects the following issues:

Issue | Level | Meaning |
| :--- | :----: | ---- |
| late&nbsp;binding&nbsp;violation | FAIL | Late binding variables referenced outside of a function - see [late binding](https://github.com/JELOS/JELOS.tv/blob/master/packages/readme.md#late-binding-variable-assignment) |
| duplicate&nbsp;function&nbsp;def | FAIL | Function defined multiple times, only last definition will be used |
| bad&nbsp;func&nbsp;-&nbsp;missing&nbsp;brace | FAIL | Opening brace (`{`) for function definition should be on same line as the function def, ie. `pre_configure_target() {` |
| intertwined&nbsp;vars&nbsp;&&nbsp;funcs | WARN | Variable assignments and logic is intertwined with functions - this is cosmetic, but variables and logic should be specified before all functions |
| unknown&nbsp;function | WARN | Could be a misspelled function, ie. `per_configure_target() {` which might fail silently.|
| ignored&nbsp;depends&nbsp;assign | WARN | Values assigned to `PKG_DEPENDS_*` outside of the global section or `configure_package()` will be ignored. |


## Add a new package to the Image
1. Think about, why you need it in the image.
    * new multimedia tool
    * add a new network tool
    * new kernel driver
    * ...
2. Find a place in the packages tree
    * look into the package tree structure, which is generally self explaind.
    * do not place it in an existing package (directory that includes a `package.mk`)
    * when you found a place, create a directory with the name of your package (use same value for `PKG_NAME`!!)
3. Create an initial `package.mk`
    * you can find a template under `packages/package.mk.template`. Copy the template into the new directory and call it `package.mk`
    * apply any required changes to your new `package.mk`
4. Find a place in the dependency tree
    * when it extend an existing package, add it there to the `PKG_DEPENDS_TARGET`/`PKG_DEPENDS_HOST` etc.
    * take a look into the path `packages/virtual`, there you should find a virtual packages, that match your new package (misc-packages should be the last option)
5. Now you can build your image
    * after the build, inside the `build-*` folder you should find a directory with your package name and -version, eg. `widget-1.2.3`.
