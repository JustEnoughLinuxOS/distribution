## We Develop with Github
We use Github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Join our discord and chat with us, we'll be happy to help you successfully implement your change.
2. Fork the repo and create your branch from `dev`.
3. Ensure your code is built locally and tested.
4. Any changes should be reflected in the documentation.
5. Issue a pull request back to our `dev` branch.

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be contributed under the same license as the original project code or under [Apache 2](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/) license when no other license applies.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
* Follow the same style as the source you are editing.
* If you are contributing new code, keep the style consistent with other similar works.
* Parameterize as much as possible, try to avoid hard coded values whenever you can.
* Use 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs when possible.
