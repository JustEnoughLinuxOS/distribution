## Donations and Funding
Thank you for your interest in donating to JELOS!  At this time we are not accepting financial contributions.  If you would like to volunteer or contribute in some way to our project, please read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/JustEnoughLinuxOS/distribution/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#contributor-covenant-code-of-conduct) and [Contributing to JELOS](https://github.com/JustEnoughLinuxOS/distribution/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-to-jelos) guides.  You are also encouraged to join us on Discord.  Our Discord invitation can be found at the top of our [WIKI home page](https://github.com/JustEnoughLinuxOS/distribution/wiki).

## Why Don't You Accept Donations?
* As an Open Source project our operational expenses are fairly low, so to us a donation of your time is much more valuable.
* Open Source development is not considered charitable activity in some parts of the world, including the United States.  Accepting donations can create unnecessary complexity for the project, and for the person donating.
				
## Build Infrastructure
Our GitHub runners are the nodes we use to build and push releases to GitHub. Trillian is our primary development host, Deepthought is our primary release builder.  Node specs can be found in the table below:

| Name | CPU | Cores/Threads | RAM | Disk | Usage |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| deepthought | Ryzen 7 5800H | 8c/16t | 32GB | 2TB NVMe SSD | GitHub Runner |
| trillian | Ryzen 7 5800H | 8c/16t | 32GB | 2TB NVMe SSD | Local Development |

## Project and Web Hosting
GitHub serves our release packages, as well as our WIKI.  Our domain, https://www.jelos.org is hosted with GitHub pages and is a simple WIKI redirect.  Currently, JELOS does not take advantage of functionality that requires a paid GitHub plan.
