Changelog:

v19:- Addressed v18 review comments from Boris Brezillon:

      - Improved bisectablity of Panfrost and drm-shmem patches by
        fixing iterim warning splats related to shrinker changes.

      - Improved commit messages

      - Reworked Lima patch to avoid adding `put_pages` flag

      - Reworked Panfrost patch that switches driver to explicit
        get/put pages by moving drm_gem_shmem_put_pages() into
        gem_mapping_release() instead of gem_free_object().

      - Updated Panfrost patch that switches driver to generic shrinker
        with more comments and minor imporovemnts.

      - Added new Panfrost patch from Boris that fixes handling of
        a partially mapped heap BOs.

    - Added link to the related Mesa MR to the commit msg of the patch
      that adds new DRM_VIRTGPU_MADVISE ioctl, like was requested by
      Gurchetan Singh.

    - Added ackes/r-b from Boris Brezillon and Maxime Ripard

    - New patches in v19:

        drm/gem: Document locking rule of vmap and evict callbacks
        drm/panfrost: Fix the error path in panfrost_mmu_map_fault_addr()

    - Factored out couple code changes into these new separate patches:

        drm/shmem-helper: Avoid lockdep warning when pages are released
        drm/shmem-helper: Turn warnings about imported GEM into errors

v18:- Added new pathes that change sgt allocation policy. Previously once
      sgt was allocated, it exsited till GEM was freed. Now sgt is destroyed
      once pages are unpinned and drivers have to manage the pages' pinning
      refcounting by themselves using get/put() and pin/unpin() pages.
      This removes pages refcounting ambiguity from the drm-shmem core.

    - Dropped patch that changed drm_gem_shmem_vmap_locked() error handling,
      like was requested by Boris Brezillon.

    - Added new patches that make minor improvements:

        - Optimize unlocked get_pages_sgt()
        - Don't free refcounted GEM

    - Dropped t-b from the Panfrost shrinker patch that was given for older
      patch version since code changed with the new sgt allocation policy.

v17:- Dropped patches that added new drm-shmem sgt flags, fixing dma-buf UAF
      in drm-prime error code path and preventing invalid page_count when GEM
      is freed. Will revist them later on and then factor them out into a
      seprate patchset.

    - Dropped patches that replaced drm_gem_shmem_free() with
      drm_gem_object_put(), they not needed anymore after changing
      drm_gem_shmem_free() to not touch reservation lock.

    - Addressed review comments from Boris Brezillon:

        - Added new patch to clean up error unwinding in
          drm_gem_shmem_vmap_locked()

        - Added new __drm_gem_shmem_put_pages() to let the callers
          to assert the held reservation lock themselves

        - Moved replacement of shmem->pages check with refcount_read()
          in drm_gem_shmem_free() to the shrinker addition patch

        - Improved commit message of the vmap_use_count patch

    - Added r-bs from Boris Brezillon that he gave to v16

v16:- Added more comments to the code for the new drm-shmem flags

    - Added r-bs from Boris Brezillon

    - Fixed typos and made impovements pointed out by Boris Brezillon

    - Replaced kref with refcount_t as was suggested by Boris Brezillon

    - Corrected placement of got_sgt flag in the Lima driver, also renamed
      flag to got_pages_sgt

    - Removed drm_gem_shmem_resv_assert_held() and made drm_gem_shmem_free()
      to free pages without a new func that doesn't touch resv lock, as was
      suggested by Boris Brezillon

    - Added pages_pin_count to drm_gem_shmem_print_info()

v15:- Moved drm-shmem reference counters to use kref that allows to
      optimize unlocked functions, like was suggested by Boris Brezillon.

    - Changed drm/gem/shmem function names to use _locked postfix and
      dropped the _unlocked, making the naming scheme consistent across
      DRM code, like was suggested by Boris Brezillon.

    - Added patch that fixes UAF in drm-shmem for drivers that import
      dma-buf and then release buffer in the import error code path.

    - Added patch that makes drm-shmem use new flag for SGT's get_pages()
      refcounting, preventing unbalanced refcounting when GEM is freed.

    - Fixed guest blob pinning in virtio-gpu driver that was missed
      previously in the shrinker patch.

    - Moved VC4 and virtio-gpu drivers to use drm_gem_put() in
      GEM-creation error code paths, which is now required by drm-shmem
      and was missed in a previous patch versions.

    - Virtio-GPU now attaches shmem pages to host on first use and not
      when BO is created. In older patch versions there was a potential
      race condition in the BO creation code path where both
      get_sgt()+object_attach() should've been made under same resv lock,
      otherwise pages could be evicted before attachment is invoked.

    - Virtio-GPU and drm-shmem shrinker patches are split into smaller
      ones.

v14:- All the prerequisite reservation locking patches landed upstream,
      previously were a part of this series in v13 and older.

        https://lore.kernel.org/dri-devel/20230529223935.2672495-1-dmitry.osipenko@collabora.com/

    - Added patches to improve locked/unlocked function names, like was
      suggested by Boris Brezillon for v13.

    - Made all exported drm-shmem symbols GPL, like was previously
      discussed with Thomas Zimmermann on this series.

    - Improved virtio-gpu shrinker patch. Now it won't detach purged BO
      when userspace closes GEM. Crosvm (and not qemu) checks res_id on
      CMD_CTX_DETACH_RESOURCE and prints noisy error message if ID is
      invalid, which wasn't noticed before.

v13:- Updated virtio-gpu shrinker patch to use drm_gem_shmem_object_pin()
      directly instead of drm_gem_pin() and dropped patch that exported
      drm_gem_pin() functions, like was requested by Thomas Zimmermann in
      v12.

v12:- Fixed the "no previous prototype for function" warning reported by
      kernel build bot for v11.

    - Fixed the missing reservation lock reported by Intel CI for VGEM
      driver. Other drivers using drm-shmem were affected similarly to
      VGEM. The problem was in the dma-buf attachment code path that led
      to drm-shmem pinning function which assumed the held reservation lock
      by drm_gem_pin(). In the past that code path was causing trouble for
      i915 driver and we've changed the locking scheme for the attachment
      code path in the dma-buf core to let exporters to handle the locking
      themselves. After a closer investigation, I realized that my assumption
      about testing of dma-buf export code path using Panfrost driver was
      incorrect. Now I created additional local test to exrecise the Panfrost
      export path. I also reproduced the issue reported by the Intel CI for
      v10. It's all fixed now by making the drm_gem_shmem_pin() to take the
      resv lock by itself.

    - Patches are based on top of drm-tip, CC'd intel-gfx CI for testing.

v11:- Rebased on a recent linux-next. Added new patch as a result:

        drm/shmem-helper: Export drm_gem_shmem_get_pages_sgt_locked()

        It's needed by the virtio-gpu driver to swap-in/unevict shmem
        object, previously get_pages_sgt() didn't use locking.

    - Separated the "Add memory shrinker" patch into smaller parts to ease
      the reviewing, as was requested by Thomas Zimmermann:

        drm/shmem-helper: Factor out pages alloc/release from
          drm_gem_shmem_get/put_pages()
        drm/shmem-helper: Add pages_pin_count field
        drm/shmem-helper: Switch drm_gem_shmem_vmap/vunmap to use pin/unpin
        drm/shmem-helper: Factor out unpinning part from drm_gem_shmem_purge()

    - Addessed the v10 review comments from Thomas Zimmermann: return errno
      instead of bool, sort code alphabetically, rename function and etc
      minor changes.

    - Added new patch to remove the "map->is_iomem" from drm-shmem, as
      was suggested by Thomas Zimmermann.

    - Added acks and r-b's that were given to v10.

v10:- Was partially applied to misc-fixes/next.

Make drm/gem API function names consistent by having locked function
use the _locked postfix in the name, while the unlocked variants don't
use the _unlocked postfix. Rename drm_gem_v/unmap() function names to
make them consistent with the rest of the API functions.

Everything that uses the mapped buffer should be agnostic to is_iomem.
The only reason for the is_iomem test is that we're setting shmem->vaddr
to the returned map->vaddr. Now that the shmem->vaddr code is gone, remove
the obsoleted is_iomem test to clean up the code.

Add separate pages_pin_count for tracking of whether drm-shmem pages are
moveable or not. With the addition of memory shrinker support to drm-shmem,
the pages_use_count will no longer determine whether pages are hard-pinned
in memory, but whether pages exist and are soft-pinned (and could be swapped
out). The pages_pin_count > 1 will hard-pin pages in memory.

Add lockless drm_gem_shmem_get_pages() helper that skips taking reservation
lock if pages_use_count is non-zero, leveraging from atomicity of the
refcount_t. Make drm_gem_shmem_mmap() to utilize the new helper.

The vmapped pages shall be pinned in memory and previously get/put_pages()
were implicitly hard-pinning/unpinning the pages. This will no longer be
the case with addition of memory shrinker because pages_use_count > 0 won't
determine anymore whether pages are hard-pinned (they will be soft-pinned),
while the new pages_pin_count will do the hard-pinning. Switch the
vmap/vunmap() to use pin/unpin() functions in a preparation of addition
of the memory shrinker support to drm-shmem.

Use refcount_t helper for vmap_use_count to make refcounting consistent
with pages_use_count and pages_pin_count that use refcount_t. This also
makes vmapping to benefit from the refcount_t's overflow checks.

Prepare drm_gem_shmem_free() to addition of memory shrinker support
to drm-shmem by adding and using variant of put_pages() that doesn't
touch reservation lock. Reservation shouldn't be touched because lockdep
will trigger a bogus warning about locking contention with fs_reclaim
code paths that can't happen during the time when GEM is freed and
lockdep doesn't know about that.

We're going to move away from having implicit get_pages() done by
get_pages_sgt() to simplify refcnt handling. Drivers will manage
get/put_pages() by themselves. Expose the drm_gem_shmem_get_pages()
in a public drm-shmem API.

All drivers will be moved to get/put pages explicitly and then the last
put_pages() will be invoked during gem_free() time by some drivers.
We can't touch reservation lock when GEM is freed because that will cause
a spurious warning from lockdep when shrinker support will be added.
Lockdep doesn't know that fs_reclaim isn't functioning for a freed object,
and thus, can't deadlock. Release pages directly without taking reservation
lock if GEM is freed and its refcount is zero.

To simplify the drm-shmem refcnt handling, we're moving away from
the implicit get_pages() that is used by get_pages_sgt(). From now on
drivers will have to pin pages while they use sgt. Lima driver doesn't
have shrinker, hence pages are pinned and sgt is valid as long as pages'
use-count > 0.

From: Boris Brezillon <boris.brezillon@collabora.com>

If some the pages or sgt allocation failed, we shouldn't release the
pages ref we got earlier, otherwise we will end up with unbalanced
get/put_pages() calls. We should instead leave everything in place
and let the BO release function deal with extra cleanup when the object
is destroyed, or let the fault handler try again next time it's called.

To simplify the drm-shmem refcnt handling, we're moving away from
the implicit get_pages() that is used by get_pages_sgt(). From now on
drivers will have to pin pages while they use sgt. Panfrost's shrinker
doesn't support swapping out BOs, hence pages are pinned and sgt is valid
as long as pages' use-count > 0.

In Panfrost, panfrost_gem_mapping, which is the object representing a
GPU mapping of a BO, owns a pages ref. This guarantees that any BO being
mapped GPU side has its pages retained till the mapping is destroyed.

Since pages are no longer guaranteed to stay pinned for the BO lifetime,
and MADVISE(DONT_NEED) flagging remains after the GEM handle has been
destroyed, we need to add an extra 'is_purgeable' check in
panfrost_gem_purge(), to make sure we're not trying to purge a BO that
already had its pages released.

We're moving away from implicit get_pages() that is done by
get_pages_sgt() to simplify the refcnt handling. Drivers will have
to pin pages while they use sgt. VirtIO-GPU doesn't support shrinker,
hence pages are pinned and sgt is valid as long as pages' use-count > 0.

In a preparation to addition of drm-shmem memory shrinker support, change
the SGT allocation policy in this way:

1. SGT can be allocated only if shmem pages are pinned at the
time of allocation, otherwise allocation fails.

2. Drivers must ensure that pages are pinned during the time of SGT usage
and should get new SGT if pages were unpinned.

This new policy is required by the shrinker because it will move pages
to/from SWAP unless pages are pinned, invalidating SGT pointer once pages
are relocated.

Previous patches prepared drivers to the new policy.

Introduce common drm-shmem shrinker for DRM drivers.

To start using drm-shmem shrinker drivers should do the following:

1. Implement evict() callback of GEM object where driver should check
   whether object is purgeable or evictable using drm-shmem helpers and
   perform the shrinking action

2. Initialize drm-shmem internals using drmm_gem_shmem_init(drm_device),
   which will register drm-shmem shrinker

3. Implement madvise IOCTL that will use drm_gem_shmem_madvise()

SGT isn't refcounted. Once SGT pointer has been obtained, it remains the
same for both locked and unlocked get_pages_sgt(). Return cached SGT
directly without taking a potentially expensive lock.

Don't free shmem object if it has pages that are in use at the time of
the GEM's freeing if DRM driver doesn't manage GEM/pages lifetime properly.
This prevents memory corruption due to the use-after-free bug in exchange
to leaking GEM.

Prepare to addition of memory shrinker support by pinning display
framebuffer BO pages in memory while they are in use by display on host.
Shrinker is free to relocate framebuffer BO pages if it doesn't know that
pages are in use, thus pin the pages to disallow shrinker to move them.

Prepare for addition of memory shrinker support by attaching shmem pages
to host dynamically on first use. Previously the attachment vq command
wasn't fenced and there was no vq kick made in the BO creation code path,
hence the attachment already was happening dynamically, but implicitly.
Making attachment explicitly dynamic will allow to simplify and reuse more
code when shrinker will be added. The virtio_gpu_object_shmem_init() now
works under the held reservation lock, which will be important to have for
shrinker to avoid moving pages while they are in active use by the driver.

  Cc: dri-devel, linux-kernel, kernel, virtualization

Support generic drm-shmem memory shrinker and add new madvise IOCTL to
the VirtIO-GPU driver. BO cache manager of Mesa driver will mark BOs as
"don't need" using the new IOCTL to let shrinker purge the marked BOs on
OOM, the shrinker will also evict unpurgeable shmem BOs from memory if
guest supports SWAP file or partition.
