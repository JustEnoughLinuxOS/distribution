Subject: [PATCH] Fix build failure with recent ax_prog_doxygen.m4

Recent autotool-archives doxygen macros breaks the current build,
so this patch updates to the method of the latest autoconf-archive version.

The required autoconf-archive macro has been committed to their repository
in November 2015, so anything later should work.
